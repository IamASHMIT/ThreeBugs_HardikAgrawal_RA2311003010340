Problem Statement : Development of a Finance Dashboard with Integrated Predictive Analytics Using Machine Learning and MERN Stack

Introduction  : The financial industry is increasingly reliant on sophisticated tools to track, analyze, and forecast financial data. Traditional finance dashboards, while effective for real-time data visualization, often fall short in providing users with predictive insights that could guide strategic financial decisions. As financial markets and data become more complex, there is a growing demand for a comprehensive solution that not only visualizes financial data but also leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to predict future trends. This project seeks to address this gap by developing a Finance Dashboard that integrates predictive analytics, enabling users to make data-driven decisions with confidence.

Solution: The primary solution of this project is to develop a cutting-edge Finance Dashboard application that combines real-time financial data visualization with predictive analytics. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, this application will provide users with an intuitive interface to manage and forecast financial trends. The project will also utilize Vite as a modern frontend development environment, Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, Material UI for a polished user interface, and Recharts for dynamic data visualization. The backend will be developed using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB serving as the database to store and manage large volumes of financial data.
